* Introduction
	- "_widespread_ use"
	- discuss some impacts of the project in this paragraph
	- Include the name Panthera

* Problem
	- good; make it sound a bit more "grand"

* Hypothesis
	- fine

* Latency Types
	- need a diagram of how Hadoop actually works w/ a Client, NameNode and DataNodes
	- "_Thus_ greatly reducing file accessing time"

* Panthera Metadata Architecture
	- this only makes sense if there is another figure explaining Hadoop

* Panthera Data Architecture
	- change the gray to something different; right now you can't really read it

* Panthera - Implementation
	- fine

* Testing Methodology - Single Node vs Multinode
	- "All testing procedures" - really?; Replace with "testing procedures"
	- "multinode" is not two words

* Results
	- The first graph needs to be colored
	- Switch out the colors
	- Deal with outliers in the first graph?

* Statistics
	- Need to add standard deviation
	- Figure out a more appealing way to present the same information

* Conclusion
	- latency and waiting time are used interchangeabley but the paragraph makes 
		it seem as though they are two different things
	- "_,_ such that those that major companies _,_"

* Future Work
	- Change it to the "Future/Ongoing Work"
	- "will be open sourced" - why not just do it right now?
	- Include something about medical diagnostics
