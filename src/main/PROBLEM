The first OP_READ_BLOCk response is being read but after that,
we need a PipelineACK from the client before we can proceed.

Solution
  - do a forever loop on reading the responses (break out of it
  once we read a packet that is last of a sequence)
  - after each read of the response, check for a pipelineAck
